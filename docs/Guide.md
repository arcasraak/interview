# Hello World

In me, past, present, future meet

过去，现在和未来，交织内心

To hold long chiding conference

长久以来，纠缠不清

My lusts usurp the present tense 

欲望侵蚀现在

And strangle Reason in his seat

将理性扼杀

My loves leap through the future's fence

爱已离去，穿越未来的藩篱

To dance with dream-enfranchised feet

与梦想的自由共舞

In me the cave-man clasps the seer

无知的内心，祈求先知

And garlanded Apollo goes 

和至高无上的阿波罗

Chanting to Abraham's deaf ear

犹如在亚伯拉罕的聋耳边吟唱

In me the tiger sniffs the rose

心有猛虎，细嗅蔷薇

Look in my heart, kind friends, and tremble

审视我的内心，颤栗吧，亲爱的朋友

Since there your elements assemble

因为你也无处可逃
